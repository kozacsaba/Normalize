/*  Should be able to calculate the Integrated LKFS of an audio file. Input
    should be either an audio file or the whole audio in an array or 100ms
    sized audio buffers, haven't decided yet. Output is obviously a float.
    Don't forget to reset / initialise before starting to process a new file.
